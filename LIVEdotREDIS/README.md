LIVEdotREDIS
============


###### General Description

LIVEdotREDIS will be used to monitor redis key values live.
It is based on a fork of release v0.1 of **LIVEdotIO**.

###### Serverside Dependencies

Make sure you have **node.js** and its corresponding package manager **npm** installed.
Also, since this is supposed to be a debug tool for REDIS, you should have a REDIS server running.

In the **Backend/** directory, run this on the terminal:
``` shell
npm install express
npm install socket.io
npm install redis
```
